# Overview

This is a example game developed using GML.  It is modeled heavily after "Flappy bird", even using some of the same assets that the original game used.  However, all the code was writen from scratch to deminstrate how you can build a game using Game Maker Studio 2.

# Known issues/plans for future development

- After achieving 10 points, the score counter bugs out, duplicating itself in a strip across the screen.
- Currently the pipes that cross the screen do not shift their position with each iteration, making for a easy game.  However, they do accelerate as the player's score increases, witch is a feature the original game did not have.

# Development Environment

This was Developed in Game Maker Studio 2, in their GML language witch has similarities to both C++ and python.
